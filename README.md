# 🍎 OrchardEye

**A dual-sensor crop health & quality scanner for Washington's 8th Congressional District.**

One scan of a fruit or leaf → two answers:
1. **Is it diseased?** — on-device computer vision classifies visible disease (or "healthy").
2. **Is it good?** — a low-cost clip-on near-infrared (NIR) sensor estimates ripeness and sugar (Brix) — internal quality the camera can't see.

…then **fuses** both into one plain-language verdict, speaks it aloud (weather-aware voice guidance), and tracks each plant's trend over the season — all on **sub-$130 hardware** that works **offline in the field**.

> Built for the **Congressional App Challenge — WA-08** (tree-fruit country: Wenatchee, Chelan, Leavenworth). Prototyped on **tomato** (abundant public data), transferred to **apple**, with **cherry** as an extension.
>
> **Pitch:** *"OrchardEye puts a $3,000 lab capability into a $100 phone attachment so the small apple and cherry growers who power my district can pick at peak quality and catch disease early — turning waste into income."*

> ⚠️ **Status:** v0.1. The planning artifacts (PRD, research, designs, build prompt) are in [`docs/`](docs/), and a **buildable native-iOS app** is in [`OrchardEye/`](OrchardEye/) — full UX with the disease model and BLE sensor stubbed behind protocols (see [the app README](OrchardEye/README.md)).

## 📱 The app

A complete **native iOS (SwiftUI)** v1 lives in **[`OrchardEye/`](OrchardEye/)** — it builds in
**Xcode 16+** and runs the full scan → quality gate → disease + crop-health → NIR ripeness/Brix →
**fused verdict** → voice + trends + confirm/correct flow, all on-device.

```bash
open OrchardEye/OrchardEye.xcodeproj   # ⌘R on an iPhone simulator
```
It's Simulator-friendly: tap a **sample leaf** and **Scan fruit** (the camera/NIR are simulated)
to walk the whole pipeline. The disease model and BLE sensor are clean **stubs** behind protocols
(`DiseaseClassifier`, `SpectralSensor`) ready for a real Core ML model and an AS7265x. See
**[`OrchardEye/README.md`](OrchardEye/README.md)** for build notes and the real-vs-stubbed map.

## 🧠 How it works (30-second version)

```
   📷 camera ─┐                                    ┌─→ 🦠 disease + crop-health score
              ├─→ quality gate → preprocess → quantized on-device models → 🧠 fusion ─→ 🟢/🟠/🔴 verdict + 🔊 voice
   🔬 NIR ────┘     (offline, < 3 s)                └─→ 🍎 ripeness + Brix          + 📈 trend chart
```

Full detail with feedback loops: **[docs/design/ai-pipeline.md](docs/design/ai-pipeline.md)**.

## 🔩 Hardware (~$118 BOM)

AS7265x spectral sensor (18 ch, 410–940 nm) + ESP32 (BLE bridge) + Brix refractometer (ground-truth) + 3D-printed dark shroud. Full list in [PRD §8](docs/PRD.md#8-hardware--bill-of-materials).

> **Honest-claims rule:** the AS7265x tops out near 940 nm — great for ripeness, chlorophyll, surface chemistry. We do **not** claim deep sugar/water bands (1450 nm), which need far pricier sensors. Rigor is the point.

## ✅ v1 success targets

| | Target |
|---|---|
| Disease accuracy (public test) | ≥ 90% |
| Disease accuracy (own field photos) | ≥ 75% *(honest domain gap)* |
| Ripeness classification | ≥ 85% |
| Brix regression | R² ≥ 0.80, RMSE ≈ 1 °Brix |
| Capture → verdict | < 3 s, on-device |
| Hardware BOM | < $130 |

## 🗺️ Roadmap

Disease MVP (tomato) → apple transfer → sensor/BLE bridge → NIR calibration set + quality models → fusion + voice + trends → field test → demo & submission. See the [milestone table](docs/PRD.md#11-milestones--timeline).

*Working name "OrchardEye" is a placeholder. Verify the current CAC deadlines, district boundaries, and representative before submission.*
